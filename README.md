This is the first repository of two for my Flatiron Javascript program.  This repository views the front end javascript, html and css.  Please also view https://github.com/JeffEckert/foodBuckets_backend to see my rails api backend code and Databases.  

This site is a food journal for anyone that would need to keep track of their meals for either diet or health purposes.

I hope you enjoy.
